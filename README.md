run testscript_1hr.py for the first experiment.

run testscript_walk_alg_ablation for ablation experiments on sampling + walking and relaxation + random flipping walking.

run exp_MNIST/exp_MNIST.py or exp_MNIST/exp_MNIST_BisonNet.py for the second experiment. The code in exp_MNIST is adopted from Gurobi-machinelearning's official sample repo: https://github.com/Gurobi/gurobi-machinelearning/tree/main/notebooks/adversarial.

Any questions on the code, please write to jt037@bucknell.edu
