Run testscript_1hr.py for the first experiment (Section 4.1).

Run testscript_walk_alg_ablation.py for ablation experiments on sampling + walking and relaxation + random flipping walking.

Run exp_MNIST/exp_MNIST.py or exp_MNIST/exp_MNIST_BisonNet.py for the second experiment. The code in exp_MNIST is adopted from Gurobi-machinelearning's official sample repo: https://github.com/Gurobi/gurobi-machinelearning/tree/main/notebooks/adversarial (Section 4.2).

Any questions about the code, please write to jt037@bucknell.edu
